How to run locally

3. To serve via localhost (recommended for routing or better testing):
   - Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000` then open http://localhost:8000

Customize
- Replace images in assets/images with your logos and product photos.
- Update copy in index.html.
- Add an e-commerce/cart backend (Shopify, Snipcart, Stripe) or integrate with a CMS (Netlify, Sanity, Contentful).
